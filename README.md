# Quiz-Homework
Worked mainly with javascript for this homework, having separate files for the script and the questions on this homework while also using html and css for basic building blocks and design
Setting the timer was the most difficult part of the project
Creating the questions was an interesting part to the project, trying not to make them too easy or too difficult.
I used google for a few different aspects of the project such as setting the timer
I also referred back to class videos when I got stuck as well as received help from fellow classmates
This project was definitely difficult, but I learned a lot from it and look forward to projects of this nature in the future
I was unsuccessful (repeatedly) making the timer and play again button active and working or even appearing at all
I was successful in figuring out the timer after looking at past class videos and redoing activities, 
I was able to make the play again button work after adjusting my style.css and inddx.html
